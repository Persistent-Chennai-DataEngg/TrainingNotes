## üî• 1. What is Apache Spark?

**Apache Spark** is a **fast, in-memory distributed computing framework** for large-scale data processing. It was designed to overcome the limitations of Hadoop‚Äôs MapReduce by:

* Performing computations in **memory (RAM)**
* Enabling **iterative** and **interactive** data processing
* Supporting **streaming, machine learning, graph**, and **SQL**

> Originally developed at UC Berkeley's AMPLab, now maintained by Apache Software Foundation.

## üíª 3. Spark Execution Modes: Local vs Cluster

Apache Spark can run in **multiple modes**, depending on your use case and scale.

### üîπ Local Mode

* Runs on a **single machine** using a single JVM
* Good for **development, testing, small-scale jobs**
* No cluster manager needed
* Example: PySpark on Jupyter Notebook

#### ‚úÖ Example Use Case:

You're testing an ETL job or learning Spark on your laptop.

```python
SparkSession.builder.master("local[*]").appName("LocalApp").getOrCreate()
```

---

### üîπ Cluster Mode

Runs Spark on a **distributed cluster**, allowing massive parallel processing.

#### Cluster Managers:

| Manager        | Description                    |
| -------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Standalone** | Built-in Spark cluster manager |
| **YARN**       | Hadoop‚Äôs resource manager      |
| **Mesos**      | General cluster manager        |
| **Kubernetes** | Container orchestration system |

#### ‚úÖ Example Use Cases:

* Large-scale ETL pipelines
* Data warehousing (Spark + Hive)
* Machine learning training jobs
* Streaming from Kafka and writing to data lakes

| Fault Tolerance | Limited                    | High ‚Äî managed across nodes        |
| Parallelism     | Limited to local CPU cores | Distributed across the cluster     |
| Cluster Manager | Not required               | YARN / Standalone / Kubernetes     |
